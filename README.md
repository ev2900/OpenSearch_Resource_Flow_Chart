I have created many resources under my GitHub account related to OpenSearch. All of the repositories related to OpenSearch can be found by searching [OpenSearch_](https://github.com/ev2900?tab=repositories&q=OpenSearch_&type=&language=&sort=) under my GitHub account.

To help understand when to use which resources. I created a flow chart hosted at the URL https://ev2900.github.io/OpenSearch_Resource_Flow_Chart/

The [flow chart](https://ev2900.github.io/OpenSearch_Resource_Flow_Chart/) can help you determine when to use which OpenSearch resources
